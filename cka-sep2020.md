CKA Exam September 2020

Duration of Exam: 2 hours
Software Version: Kubernetes v1.19

The new exam is of 2 hours, instead of 3 hours, and gives a lot of weightage to Troubleshooting. Following are the Domain & Competencies, which the exam aims to check:-

Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration – 25%
Workloads & Scheduling – 15%
Services & Networking – 20%
Storage – 10%
Troubleshooting – 30%

It is not a disruptive change.
It is now for 2 hours, which I believe sufficient to attempt 17 questions.
Quality of questions is better.
The questions are as per the breakdown mentioned above. You should expect a good amount of questions on kubeadm, RBAC and Troubleshooting.
The pass percentage is now 66%. I am not sure if this was changed from 74% earlier.
